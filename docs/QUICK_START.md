## 🚀 Immediate Next Step

**Start Task 1.1: Discovery Strategy**

What I'll do:
1. Research 10 major dealer platforms (AutoNation, CarMax, Toyota, etc.)
2. Find their location page patterns
3. Document: `/locations`, `/dealerships`, sitemap patterns
4. Build heuristic discovery engine (try all patterns)
5. Test on 5 real dealerships

**Time:** 1-2 days
**Deliverable:** Can drop any dealer URL and discover all locations

---

## 🤔 Before I Start

**Quick questions:**

1. **Want me to start now?** (Task 1.1: Discovery Strategy)
2. **Any specific dealerships to test first?** (I'll test AutoNation, CarMax by default)
3. **Priority?** (Speed first vs. completeness first)
4. **Reporting?** (Daily updates? Weekly summaries?)
